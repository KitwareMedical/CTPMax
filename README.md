# CTPMax
Repository for Registration and making of composites of .nrrd CTA and CTP files.

PixelMax.ipynb is made in Linux using ITK, and the Registration is done using terminal commands with ITKTubeTK Registration.

Terminal commands do not handle spaces as part of the same file name, so NameChange.ipynb changes every space or double-space into a single hyphen.

The masks used in PixelMax.ipynb were also created using ITKTubeTK using ImageMath.

The datasets used in this project are available at data.kitware.com.
